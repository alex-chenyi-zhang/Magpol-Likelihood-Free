# Magpol-Likelihood-Free

In the /magpoly/src/ folder you find the source code for the simulator. In particular "structures_and_functions.jl" contain all the functions, the associated methods and structures to carry out MCMC simulation of the magnetic polymer with a single markov chain. In "magpoly.jl" there is the code (that uses "structures_and_functions.jl") that implements the multiple markov chains algorithm.
These two files are the code for the simulator.
