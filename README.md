# Magpol-Likelihood-Free

In the /magpoly/src/ folder you find the source code for the simulator. In particular "structures_and_functions.jl" contain all the functions, the associated methods and structures to carry out MCMC simulation of the magnetic polymer with a single markov chain. In "magpoly.jl" there is the code (that uses "structures_and_functions.jl") that implements the multiple markov chains algorithm.
These two files are the code for the simulator. Different likelihood-free algorithms will exploit the data generated by this simulator. Expect for small tweaks they should not be modified further (not anything major) and the code for the various inference algo's should be written in separate modules.
